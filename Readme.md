My Personal Portfolio Website
Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This project is a modern, fully responsive single-page application built with React and Tailwind CSS. It's designed to showcase my skills, feature my projects, and provide a seamless way for visitors to get in touch with me.

This isn't just a template; it's a carefully crafted digital space that represents my professional identity as a Full-Stack Developer.


About Me
I am a passionate and driven full-stack developer with a strong foundation in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). I specialize in creating beautiful, responsive, and highly functional web applications that provide exceptional user experiences. With a background in computer engineering and a keen eye for detail, I enjoy solving complex problems and turning innovative ideas into clean, efficient, and scalable code.

My work includes developing full-stack platforms from scratch, integrating real-time features with WebRTC and Socket.IO, and building robust RESTful APIs. I am also an avid learner, constantly exploring new technologies and improving my skills to stay at the forefront of web development. This portfolio is a reflection of my journey, my capabilities, and my dedication to the craft.
